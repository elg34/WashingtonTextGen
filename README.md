# WashingtonTextGen

LSTM for predicting text by George Washington

This is not a fully optimised network, but more of a quick way to practice running LSTMs using keras.
The .py file creates and trains model, works best if you can run it on the GPU.
The Jupyter notebook is for easy text generation with the final model.
